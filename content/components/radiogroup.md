# RadioGroup

The global data-control twin renders real radio inputs from CSV or bound option data and writes the selected value back.

<RefMeta platforms="Web,iOS,Android">
Category: Input - Live specimens: the [System gallery](/system).
</RefMeta>

## Usage

```dsx
<RadioGroup bind="dsx.variable.plan" options="Weekly,Monthly,Yearly"/>
```

`RadioGroup` takes no children.

## Catalog specimen

`RadioGroupDefault.dsx`, verbatim from the catalog:

```dsx
<RadioGroup bind="dsx.variable.plan" options="Weekly,Monthly,Yearly" style="width: 100%">
  <head>
    <variable as="plan">return 'Monthly'</variable>
  </head>
</RadioGroup>
```

Every component in the library is authored at four rungs in the catalog (default, system words, one property override, fully custom), so the cost of leaving the system design is visible in one place. The [System gallery](/system) runs them.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | probe: role=radiogroup, ArrowDown moves selection + writes store, .dsx-radio-option:hover fill, focus ring on radio input - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-* |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Per-option system Buttons (.plain) with filled/hollow marks, 44pt targets, group-level W9 disabled grammar (ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Core/swift/RadioGroup.swift:60-90); CI-asserted on iPad (Alpha to Beta flip refreshes the native selected state, ClosedSource/RuntimeUITests/RuntimeLaunchUITests.swift) and driven on Catalyst (inspector matrix Everything). Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: unstyled path renders REAL M3 RadioButton rows in a selectableGroup (ChoiceElements.kt M3 path, SelectionControl.RADIOGROUP - SelectionSystemTest green): platform state layers; legacy path rows via dsxAccessibleSelectable + SF glyphs (ChoiceElements.kt:239); disabled= in the contract. |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bind` | `expr` |  |  |
| `color` | `color` | `var(--dsx-accent)` |  |
| `disabled` | `bool` | `false` |  |
| `disabled-if` | `expr` |  | Disabled when this expression is truthy. `disabled=` binds as TEXT, and the string "false" is TRUE - so a bound boolean belongs here, never there. |
| `labelField` | `string` | `label` |  |
| `options` | `csv` |  |  |
| `optionsKey` | `expr` |  |  |
| `valueField` | `string` | `id` |  |

Every element also carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes): accessibility, animation, `class`, `style` and the platform suffixes.

## Events

`RadioGroup` raises no events.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `supported` | the built in renderer implements this element |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `enforced` | implemented and pinned by the element parity test |

The global data-control twin renders real radio inputs from CSV or bound option data and writes the selected value back.

**Known limits on the web**

- Options and labels are bounded by the shared data-control safety ceilings.

**Implementation notes.** Glyphs: largecircle.fill.circle / circle (RadioGroup.swift:57).

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** identical presentation at 390 touch and 1366 fine pointer by declaration (probed both, page overflow 0; only density tokens move); RTL mount: overflow 0, leading alignment mirrors (btn right edge flush) - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-*

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-radio-group`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `global`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | role=radiogroup + aria-label, roving radios, arrow keys; axe 0 serious/critical on the controls family page light+dark (calendar excluded, filed) |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Option labels + isSelected add/remove through distinct subtrees (ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Core/swift/RadioGroup.swift:80-88); CI-asserted: the selected trait refreshes and the deselected option drops it (ClosedSource/RuntimeUITests/RuntimeLaunchUITests.swift). Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: selectableGroup column of selectable rows (M3 path) / dsxAccessibleSelectable(Role.RadioButton) with selected state + Enter/Space (legacy, ChoiceElements.kt:239, AccessibilityModifiers.kt:135); on-device: DsxAccessibilityUiTest selects a RadioGroup option via semantics (assertIsSelectable/Selected on the <RadioGroup options="One,Two"/> fixture row). |

Every element carries `a11yLabel`, `a11yHint`, `a11yValue`, `a11yTrait`, `a11yGroup` and `a11yHidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
