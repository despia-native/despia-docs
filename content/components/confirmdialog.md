# confirmDialog

The overlay twin provides an adaptive confirm dialog with modal semantics, normalized actions, focus containment/restoration, and dismissal.

<RefMeta platforms="Web,iOS,Android">
Category: Overlay - Live specimens: the [System gallery](/system).
</RefMeta>

## Usage

```dsx
<confirmDialog present="dsx.variable.confirm" title="Delete episode?" buttons="dsx.variable.dialogButtons" on:dismiss="dsx.variable.confirm = false"/>
```

`confirmDialog` takes no children.

## Catalog specimen

`ConfirmDialogDefault.dsx`, verbatim from the catalog:

```dsx
<vstack style="width: 100%; gap: 8px">
  <head>
    <variable as="confirm">return false</variable>
    <variable as="dialogButtons">return [{ title: 'Delete', role: 'destructive' }, { title: 'Cancel', role: 'cancel' }]</variable>
  </head>
  <button label="Delete episode" style="width: 100%" on:tap="dsx.variable.confirm = true"/>
  <confirmDialog present="dsx.variable.confirm" title="Delete episode?" buttons="dsx.variable.dialogButtons"
                 on:dismiss="dsx.variable.confirm = false"/>
</vstack>
```

Every component in the library is authored at four rungs in the catalog (default, system words, one property override, fully custom), so the cost of leaving the system design is visible in one place. The [System gallery](/system) runs them.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | probe: opens, destructive button voice rgb(201,42,42), button click fires on:dismiss, focus moves in - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-* |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Present/dismiss lifecycle (two-way bool + on:dismiss on any close), role-tinted actions, automatic Cancel appended when the list omits one (ConfirmDialogAnchor actions, ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Structure/ConfirmDialog/swift/ConfirmDialog.swift). Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: REAL M3 AlertDialog (Dialogs.kt, shared with `<alert>`): Material owns touch states/scrim/BACK; auto-appends a localized Cancel when no cancel role is present; destructive role paints the M3 error emphasis. |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `buttons` | `expr` |  |  |
| `message` | `string` |  |  |
| `on:dismiss` | `action` |  |  |
| `present` | `expr` |  |  |
| `title` | `string` |  |  |

Every element also carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes): accessibility, animation, `class`, `style` and the platform suffixes.

## Events

| Event | Handler |
|---|---|
| `dismiss` | `on:dismiss="..."` |

A payload arrives FLAT in the handler scope, so a declared action names the key bare (`message="message"`), never through an `event` plane.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `supported` | the built in renderer implements this element |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `enforced` | implemented and pinned by the element parity test |

The overlay twin provides an adaptive confirm dialog with modal semantics, normalized actions, focus containment/restoration, and dismissal.

**Known limits on the web**

- Visual placement adapts to Web viewport/input rather than cloning platform dialog chrome.

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** desktop: centered alertdialog; 390 touch: bottom action sheet (role=dialog panel 374x178 anchored bottom) - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-*

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-overlay-host dsx-confirm-host`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `overlay`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | role=alertdialog desktop / dialog action-sheet compact, destructive voice color, axe clean while open - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-* |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | The system confirmation dialog carries full assistive semantics (button roles incl. destructive/cancel, VoiceOver focus capture); labels localize via DSXStrings. ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Structure/ConfirmDialog/swift/ConfirmDialog.swift. Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: M3 AlertDialog accessibility component-owned + localized button labels via DSXStrings (Dialogs.kt). |

Every element carries `a11yLabel`, `a11yHint`, `a11yValue`, `a11yTrait`, `a11yGroup` and `a11yHidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
