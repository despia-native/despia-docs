# DSXWebView

The rich Web twin mounts the composed app web surface as the same policy-constrained iframe WebView rides, resolving path against this page's own origin (an explicit origin wins) with the shared lifecycle events and the named-surface controls the Dom facet targets.

<RefMeta platforms="Web,iOS,Android">
Category: Web - Live specimens: the [System gallery](/system).
</RefMeta>

## Usage

```dsx
<DSXWebView path="/"/>
```

`DSXWebView` takes no children.

## Catalog specimen

`DSXWebViewDefault.dsx`, verbatim from the catalog:

```dsx
<vstack style="gap: 6px; max-width: 260px">
  <head/>
  <text value="DSXWebView shows one of this app's own routes inside a web view."/>
  <text value="Web: partial. iOS and Android: the real thing." class="partial-note"/>
</vstack>
```

Every component in the library is authored at four rungs in the catalog (default, system words, one property override, fully custom), so the cost of leaving the system design is visible in one place. The [System gallery](/system) runs them.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive host embed (the policy-constrained app-surface iframe): no interaction-state axis on the host itself; load/ready lifecycle is value-driven events, and the embedded page owns its own interactive states (OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json DSXWebView row; packages/dom/src/elements.ts dsx-webview factory). |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Lifecycle states are first-class: an origin-less mount renders the native DSXWebUnavailable screen WITHOUT instantiating WKWebView (body guard, ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Core/Dom/Components/Views/DSXWebView/swift/DSXWebView.swift), and screen readiness gates the frame settle on domFinish/domFail (store.hostsWebSurface; Conformance/lifecycle/readiness.json rule 9, record lane); CI-asserted native fallback (ClosedSource/RuntimeUITests/RuntimeLaunchUITests.swift testOriginlessDSXWebViewSelectsNativeErrorBeforeCreatingWebView). Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: load-failure policy is DomFailurePolicy.kt (Dom module kotlin facet) + the native recoverable system error screen (Try again) asserted by instrumentation: DsxSystemScreenUiTest#compiledFrameworkFailureIsNativeResponsiveAndRecoverable + DomFailurePolicyTest (RuntimeAndroid androidTest); page-level states are the loaded web content's own. |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `on:commit` | `action` |  | Navigation committed - payload { url, surface }. |
| `on:denied` | `action` |  | The bridge gate refused a foreign frame - payload { origin, url, surface }. |
| `on:fail` | `action` |  | Navigation failed - payload { url, surface, error, code }. |
| `on:finish` | `action` |  | Navigation finished - payload { url, surface }. |
| `on:message` | `action` |  | The page called window.app.send - payload { data, surface }. |
| `on:start` | `action` |  | Navigation started - payload { url, surface }. |
| `origin` | `string` |  |  |
| `path` | `string` | `/` |  |

Every element also carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes): accessibility, animation, `class`, `style` and the platform suffixes.

## Events

| Event | Handler |
|---|---|
| `commit` | `on:commit="..."` |
| `denied` | `on:denied="..."` |
| `fail` | `on:fail="..."` |
| `finish` | `on:finish="..."` |
| `message` | `on:message="..."` |
| `start` | `on:start="..."` |

A payload arrives FLAT in the handler scope, so a declared action names the key bare (`message="message"`), never through an `event` plane.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `partial` | a renderer exists and is narrower than the reference in the ways listed below |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `module-facet` | filled by the module facet when that module is registered |
| desktop | `unavailable` | the desktop build bundles no runtime for it and answers with a typed refusal |

The rich Web twin mounts the composed app web surface as the same policy-constrained iframe WebView rides, resolving path against this page's own origin (an explicit origin wins) with the shared lifecycle events and the named-surface controls the Dom facet targets.

**Known limits on the web**

- No BridgeKit bridge is faked: the embedded page gets the plain window.app.send channel and the bridge-gate on:denied event never fires on Web.
- The screen-readiness hostedSurface gate stays native-only: a web frame does not defer settled to the embedded page's first paint.
- Browser sandbox and storage behavior cannot duplicate the native composed-surface WKWebView process/data-store guarantees.

**Fallback.** Mounts the functional policy-constrained iframe at origin+path (defaulting to this page's own origin); bridge-dependent behavior is absent rather than imitated.

**Implementation notes.** The composed app web surface (bare construction + BridgeKit). Android twin: Core/Dom/android/DSXWebViewComponent.kt registers the same tag.

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** Pure fill-its-container embed host: the embedded page owns its presentation at every width; the host declares no phone/tablet/desktop variance of its own (OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json DSXWebView row).

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-webview`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `rich`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | no, and named | 2026-08-18 | W11 disposition (b), dated decision: the twin mounts a policy-constrained iframe without the BridgeKit bridge (OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json DSXWebView row keeps status partial, 'No BridgeKit bridge is faked'); the composed app-surface contract incl. its a11y tree is native-owned per OpenSource/Documentation/architecture/web-surface-policy.md, so the web host is not held to the library axe/keyboard bar. Red-by-record. |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | WKWebView exposes the loaded page's accessibility tree to assistive tech (WebKit-owned); the component adds no native chrome; page-side a11y is the web column's plane. ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Core/Dom/Components/Views/DSXWebView/swift/DSXWebView.swift. Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: the platform android.webkit.WebView exposes the loaded page's own web accessibility tree; the failure screen is native Compose text + button (DsxSystemScreenUiTest asserts it is reachable and clickable). |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Every element carries `a11yLabel`, `a11yHint`, `a11yValue`, `a11yTrait`, `a11yGroup` and `a11yHidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
