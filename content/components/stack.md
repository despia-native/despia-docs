# stack

The base Web twin provides the generic DSX flex/display container and universal spacing/alignment/style contract.

<RefMeta platforms="Web,iOS,Android">
Category: Layout - Live specimens: the [System gallery](/system).
</RefMeta>

## Usage

```dsx
<stack style="flex-direction: row; gap: 1rem"><text value="A"/><text value="B"/></stack>
```

`stack` takes children.

## Catalog specimen

`StackDefault.dsx`, verbatim from the catalog:

```dsx
<stack style="width: 100%; flex-direction: row; gap: 16px">
  <head/>
  <text value="A"/>
  <text value="B"/>
</stack>
```

Every component in the library is authored at four rungs in the catalog (default, system words, one property override, fully custom), so the cost of leaving the system design is visible in one place. The [System gallery](/system) runs them.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| ios | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| android | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `align` | `string` |  |  |
| `alignItems` | `flex-start` \| `center` \| `flex-end` \| `baseline` \| `stretch` |  |  |
| `display` | `flex` \| `grid` | `flex` |  |
| `flexDirection` | `column` \| `row` | `column` |  |
| `spacing` | `number` | `0` |  |

Every element also carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes): accessibility, animation, `class`, `style` and the platform suffixes.

## Events

`stack` raises no events.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `supported` | the built in renderer implements this element |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `enforced` | implemented and pinned by the element parity test |

The base Web twin provides the generic DSX flex/display container and universal spacing/alignment/style contract.

**Known limits on the web**

- CSS flex/grid layout owns browser-specific fractional rounding.

**Implementation notes.** The generic CSS-driven container. Cross-axis default: column -> leading, row -> center (crossHAlign/crossVAlign, StackContainerElement.swift:58-72).

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** layout primitive: presentation IS the authored geometry, declared identical across widths; probed at 390/1366 with overflow 0 and RTL mirror (hstack reverses, logical properties) - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-*

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-stack`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `base`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | neutral div; axe 0 serious/critical on the chrome family page light + dark-390 |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Transparent layout container: children carry their own semantics; the kernel a11y pass applies on any element (StackStyle.apply, OpenSource/Engine/iOS/Stack.swift:6060-6092: a11yLabel/aria-label, a11yHint, a11yValue, a11yTrait/role, a11yGroup, a11yHidden; on:tap implies .isButton). ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Basics/Stack/swift/StackContainerElement.swift. Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: transparent layout container: children own their semantics. |

Every element carries `a11yLabel`, `a11yHint`, `a11yValue`, `a11yTrait`, `a11yGroup` and `a11yHidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
