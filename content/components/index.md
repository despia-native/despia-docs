# Components

69 components, one page each. Every page is a projection of the ledgers: the census for the attribute and event contract, the library matrix for the audited platform record, the web element ledger for the limits, and the catalog for the specimen. Nothing on a page is written by hand, so nothing on a page can quietly go stale.

68 of the 69 have a specimen the catalog serves today; the rest say so on their own page.

## Media

<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="audio" href="/components/audio">
The media Web twin implements the fixture's full transport/readout contract: headless HTMLMediaElement playback, reactive transport/scrubbing bindings, bounded ready/time/buffering/error events, a 15-second load deadline, teardown, feature-detected Media Session commands, and the session= playback/ambient category applied through the page-scoped Audio Session API where the engine has one.

</Card>
<Card title="scene" href="/components/scene">
The DSX-native scene root renders in the browser through the in-kernel WebGL surface installed by registerSceneSurface, over the same corpus-pinned scene fold (transform composition, projection, picking) the two native lanes and the Compose desktop rasterizer read, so a scene cannot mean one thing here and another on a phone.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Data

<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="chart" href="/components/chart">
The rich Web twin renders accessible SVG line, area, bar and point charts from bound data - multi-series with palette or single color=, stacked= areas and bars (domain from the stack totals, bands closing on the previous layer), legend= at the census positions (a figcaption, so assistive tech reads it as the caption), xType=time positioning by parsed timestamps with the kernel timeTicks ladder, y2Key/y2Color riding a labeled secondary axis, animate= draw-in (reduced-motion instant), interpolation=linear|smooth|monotone|step, grids, and deterministic downsampling.
</Card>
<Card title="map" href="/components/map">
The rich Web twin renders a REAL basemap when tiles= names a source - a self-hosted Protomaps .pmtiles archive (range-read, MVT-decoded, canvas-painted in the Despia neutral language with archive-metadata attribution) or a raster {z}/{x}/{y} template - plus accessible pins and pointer/keyboard pan/zoom; without tiles= it is the honest offline coordinate plane.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Web

<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="DSXView" href="/components/dsxview">
The rich Web twin mounts the screen component src names from this build's compiled registry (the web reading of the native rule that a shipped tag of the same name always wins), with reactive src re-resolution, the stable dsx-view lifecycle events, and a labelled unavailable state.
</Card>
<Card title="DSXWebView" href="/components/dsxwebview">
The rich Web twin mounts the composed app web surface as the same policy-constrained iframe WebView rides, resolving path against this page's own origin (an explicit origin wins) with the shared lifecycle events and the named-surface controls the Dom facet targets.
</Card>
<Card title="WebView" href="/components/webview">
The rich Web twin provides a policy-constrained iframe, lifecycle events, named controls, safe URL schemes, and ephemeral isolation.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Beyond the elements

<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="Declarations" href="/components/declarations">
The tags that render nothing and declare everything: state, actions, formulas, styles, slots.
</Card>
<Card title="Universal attributes" href="/components/attributes">
The vocabulary every element carries: accessibility, animation, class, style, platform suffixes.
</Card>
<Card title="Native first elements" href="/components/native-only">
The rows whose essence is a platform or vendor runtime the web renderer does not ship.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Web/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
